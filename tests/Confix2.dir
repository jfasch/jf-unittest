# STAGE 1
# -------

# Working on a unittest framework without having a unittest framework
# requires a little extra effort - how do we test that the framework
# works? Automake supports some basic notion of testing, and we use it
# to execute our "bootstrap" program, before we move on to more
# sophisticated tests. (Reminds me of what I saw when I had a view
# into the "Das U-Boot" bootloader.)

# STAGE 2
# -------

# Now that we know that it works basically, we go on to more advanced
# tests. we can verify that setup/teardown works, for example. We
# still have no fancy output generators however.

# Note that the tests that are executed here must not use
# setup/teardown, and that there are no TestResult implementations
# used that use the enter/leave calls.

# STAGE 3
# -------

# Here we have fully tested the test framework, so we are free to test
# everything we want.
