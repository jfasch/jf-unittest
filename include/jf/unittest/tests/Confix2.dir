# DISCLAIMER: THIS DIRECTORY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF ONE OF CONFIX'S
# MAJOR FEATURES - MAKING HEADER FILES VISIBLE UNDER A DIFFERENT PATH
# THAN THEY ARE PYHSICALLY LOCATED IN.

# although I don't like the headers not living in the same directory
# as the C files they accompany, I make compromises for people who
# like the funky hopping buttons of sappy build tools (Tom G., trying
# to build this with Visual Studio).
